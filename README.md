I am a PhD candidate at Johns Hopkins working on additive manufacturing materials and data analysis. I'm uploading some of the tools (mostly MATLAB) that I am cleared to release here so maybe they will help you as well.

I would say you'd need MATLAB 2018 or newer as well as an install of MTEX (found here: https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/)

Goes without saying, my background is in materials science not computer science, so all this code comes with the disclaimer that your mileage may vary.
